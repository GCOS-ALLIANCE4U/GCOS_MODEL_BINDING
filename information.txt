ðŸ’œ PROJET SAP UI5 => MODEL BINDING ðŸ’š

ðŸ’œ MODELS

Models are two types = > Client side and server side models. Models are containers which store data in it. When models are initialised in SAP UI5 framework, a couple of instance will be created. 
One instance is for basic model, one instance is for data binding. 

Data binding instance is initialized when you are initializing a model.

Models are used in case of data binding, to fetch and to communicate with the data base. Models are responsable to pull all data from data base to the fron end which is app that running on the browser. 

We have two types of data: 1) Which is available directly in your local file 2) The real time data which will be fetch from your database.

For SAP UI5, first we have to read data from data base, and store this data in model. After that the data will be pulled from the model to the table. For this reason we use data binding. 

We have two types of models => Client-Side Models and Server-Side Models

CLIENT SIDE MODELS => JSON Model, Resource Model, XML Model

SERVER SIDE MODELS => Odata V2 Model, Odata V4 Model

JSON => JavaScript Object Notation Data

To see the JSON data, go to the https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.List

Then on this page inspect, and go to the network tab. 

Then click on this lien  https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/entity/sap.m.List

Then choose an example like sample : List - deletion, as soon as we choose a sample, the data will be read. 

In the table, we can see all the products which come from a json file. If we can search the json file, it is ProductCollection
file. When we double click on this file, we can see all the data as JSON format.

ðŸ’œ JSON data is very less if we compare with it XML data. We can see the size in the size tab. 

Then open OData Service https://www.odata.org/, click on the Developers and then Reference Services.

We have three OData version. V4, V3, V2; we will use V2

Open OData (read/write) Service this is xml structure. Here the data is in the xml format

Go to the Products 

First click it then write Products https://services.odata.org/V2/(S(trbi1k54c0ts1h0vpbloxdl4))/OData/OData.svc/

https://services.odata.org/V2/(S(trbi1k54c0ts1h0vpbloxdl4))/OData/OData.svc/Products

If I go to the Network tab, I can see the size of the this xml format = 1.9 kB

Now write it in the JSON format and then reload the page to see the difference (add ?$format=json) = 1.4kB

https://services.odata.org/V2/(S(trbi1k54c0ts1h0vpbloxdl4))/OData/OData.svc/Products?$format=json

ðŸ’œ JSON MODEL DECLARATION => two ways

    1) You can declare JSON model directly inside manifest.json file
    2) You can declare that model inside controller

ðŸ’š In this example, I will declare JSON model directly inside manifest.json. 

ðŸ’š Before we declare a JSON model, we need a data source to read data. 

ðŸ’š First in the model folder, we create a local json file which is Product.json
